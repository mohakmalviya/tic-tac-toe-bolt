# 🎮 I made a strategic twist on Tic-Tac-Toe with React Native!

Hey everyone! 👋 

Just finished building **Tic-Tac-Toe Bolt** - it's not your typical tic-tac-toe game. Here's the twist that makes it actually strategic:

## 🧠 **The Game-Changer:**
When both players have 3 pieces on the board, the **oldest piece becomes "shadowed"** and gets removed on the next move. This creates a constantly evolving board where you need to think several moves ahead!

**Piece Lifecycle**: Active → Shadowed → Removed ♻️

## ⚡ **Features:**
- 🏠 **Local multiplayer** (pass & play)
- 🌐 **Online multiplayer** with room codes
- ⏱️ **15-second turn timer** (keeps it fast-paced)
- 📱 **Cross-platform** (Android/iOS/Web)

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
React Native + Expo + Supabase (for real-time multiplayer)

The shadowing mechanic completely changes the strategy - you can't just block anymore, you have to think about timing and piece positioning. It's like chess meets tic-tac-toe!

**Free to download** - built this as a passion project to explore real-time multiplayer with Supabase.

What do you think? Have you tried building any classic games with a twist? 🤔
